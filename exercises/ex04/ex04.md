## Question 3

In Lecture 6, we defined a class ``Tree`` as a subclass of ``Graph``.
The complete code is in
  
  [trees.py](../../examples/trees.py)

from which you should import everything when solving this question and the next one.

Then we had to be careful with the ``add_edge()`` method to guarantee that the objects of this class really were valid trees.
An alternative definition of trees is completely different: it defines trees as a **recursive** data structure, where a tree is constructed from a root node and a list of its subtrees - which in turn need to be trees.
In addition to ``__init__()``, it is then useful to export the method ``parts()``, which extracts the root and the subtrees:
```
    class RecTree:
        def __init__(self, r, ts):
            self._root = r
            self._subtrees = ts

        def parts(self):
            return self._root, self._subtrees
```
To make it easier to define trees, we also want to have a function ``atom()``, which constructs a tree with no subtrees, to be used for the leaves of the tree:
Here is an example of a ``RecTree``:
```
    extree = RecTree(1, [RecTree(11, [atom(111), atom(112)]), atom(12)]) 
```
visualized

![rectree](./rectree.png)

Your task is now to define
```
    # methods of RecTree

        # a list of edges from which a Graph can be constructed  
        def edges(self):

        # conversion to the Tree class of Lecture 6
        def to_tree(self):


    # a helper function to construct atomic trees
    def atom(a):  
```
To test this, you should run
```
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        visualize(extree.to_tree())
```
which uses the `visualize()` function defined in Lecture 6.


## Question 4

The ``RecTree`` class of Question 3 has one clear advantage over ``trees.Tree``: you can use the same node in different places in the tree.
This is common for instance in **syntax trees**, where the expression ``2 + 2`` can be represented as
```
    RecTree('+', [atom('2'), atom('2')]) 
```
The ``to_tree()`` method of Question 3 could not convert this to a valid ``trees.Tree``.
But there is an alternative method that can be used:
```
        # conversion to the ValTree class of Lecture 6
        def to_valtree(self):
```
The idea is to convert the nodes of ``RecTree`` into **values** in the ``ValTree``, whereas the vartices are generated by a unique numbering.

The proper visualization of the resulting tree will then show the values rather than the vertices, which is another thing you can implemente. 


## Question 5

Define a class ``Fun`` that supports **function composition** via overloading of multiplication.
The general equation for function composition is
```
  (g * f)(x) = g(f(x))
```
Test your solution by running the following script,which shows expected results together with results from your solution:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    f = Fun(lambda x: x+1)
    g = Fun(lambda x: 3*x)

    print(9, f(8))
    print(34, g(8))
    print()
    print(27, (g*f)(8))
    print(30, (g*f*f)(8))
    print(81, (g*g*f)(8))
    print(28, (f*g*f)(8))
```
